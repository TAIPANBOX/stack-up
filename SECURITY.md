# Security Policy

stack-up runs the open TAIPANBOX agent-governance stack on your own machine,
natively, building every plane from source and binding everything to
loopback only, so its trust boundary is that machine and whatever it clones
and compiles onto it.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security issues privately, not in public issues or pull
requests: open a GitHub private security advisory at
<https://github.com/TAIPANBOX/stack-up/security/advisories/new>. Include the
affected version or commit, a description and a minimal reproduction. We aim
to acknowledge within a few days and to fix high-severity issues before any
public disclosure, with coordinated disclosure within 90 days of the report.
There is no bug-bounty programme; reporters are credited in the advisory
unless they prefer otherwise.

## Supported versions

Before this repository's 1.0, only `main` is supported: fixes land on `main`
and are not backported. From its 1.0 tag, the newest minor gets every fix and
the previous minor gets security-relevant fixes for 90 days after the newer
one is tagged.

## Verifying a build

Every change passes the repository's gates before merge: `shellcheck up.sh
down.sh routines.sh`, `bash -n` on all three, `scripts/loopback-only.sh` and
`scripts/gates-have-teeth.sh`.
